# pathFinder
A command line based program that reads data from a txt file that contains information about a graph (its nodes and its vertices). The program finds the shortest distance between any two nodes in that given graph.
To use this program, open up Path.java from the command line and enter 3 arguments. Each argument must be separated by a space.

1)The starting node (an integer value from 0 to n-1 where n = number of nodes)
2)The ending node
3)The location of the txt file

Included is an example of a txt file containing information about a graph.
